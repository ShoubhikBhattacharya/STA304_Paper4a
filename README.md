This paper contains the R project used in creating the paper "Places of child delivery and health: Trends from Turkey in the 1998 Demographic and Health Survey".

Abstract: A familyâ€™s future health and wellness largely depends on the well-being
  of the mother and the child at birth. Therefore, choice of place of delivery play
  an important role in determining the wellness of the family. Delivery in a healthcare
  facility generally brings better outcome for both the mother and the child, so our
  primary goal is to analyze the factors influencing the choice of child delivery.
  In order to do that, we obtain a dataset from the Turkish Demographic and Health
  Surveys from 1998. Then we convert the dataset into a usable dataset to analyze
  the factors affecting choices of places of delivery. In doing so, we conclude that
  place of delivery can be indicative of maternal and child health, which can also
  provide a broader context of the overall health and well-being of the people in
  Turkey.
