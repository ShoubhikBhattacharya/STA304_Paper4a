subtitle: Health Trends in 1998 from Turkish Demographic and Health Surveys
abstract: A familyâ€™s future health and wellness largely depends on the well-being
  of the mother and the child at birth. Therefore, choice of place of delivery play
  an important role in determining the wellness of the family. Delivery in a healthcare
  facility generally brings better outcome for both the mother and the child, so our
  primary goal is to analyze the factors influencing the choice of child delivery.
  In order to do that, we obtain a dataset from the Turkish Demographic and Health
  Surveys from 1998. Then we convert the dataset into a usable dataset to analyze
  the factors affecting choices of places of delivery. In doing so, we conclude that
  place of delivery can be indicative of maternal and child health, which can also
  provide a broader context of the overall health and well-being of the people in
  Turkey.

# Introduction

Place of delivery and fertility is a central issue regarding women's health. To promote safe and informed decisions on health policy, it is essential to understand the place of delivery is for children and mothers. The data originates from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) where their purpose is to assist policy makers in governing a nation. The objective for the DHS is to expand health information and populations in survey countries. This paper includes data from the Turkish Demographic and Health Survey from 1998. The original report includes information regarding fertility, child mortality, indicators of health, and family planning. Although, we focus on analyzing places of delivery during childbirth and what factors impact that decision.

Place of delivery can be indicative of maternal and child health, and can provide broader context for overall health in Turkey. An analysis of various variables that can impact places of delivery, can provide knowledge on how those variables can potentially affect other aspects of global health. To create a usable data set we input all the data from the table in DHS into Excel, which became the raw csv file for our analysis. We examined the distribution of each variable in the data set in relation to place of delivery to identify the most influential elements. Furthermore, we created a simulation to understand the most dominant factors and predict the place of delivery for populations in Turkey. Our findings indicate that the location that women utilize for their place of delivery can be influenced by a variety of factors. Our plots showcase how a more highly educated woman, or individual from more urban areas prefer health facilities. These factors can also intersect in the decision of place of delivery and other health factors. Although, this can be representative of a lack of access for women with less privileged socioeconomic backgrounds. 

The well-being of a mother and child at birth determines the health of the next generation by helping picture future public health challenges for families, communities, and the health care system. Therefore, by analyzing the factors affecting choice of places of delivery, it can allow us to identify existing health risks in women and hence prevent potential health risks for women and their children. The paper begins by explaining the motivation behind the data and the analysis. Followed by the composition of the data obtained from the 1998 Turkey DHS. Afterwards, we go in depth about the methodology. Our data section contains plots that summarize the variables and an accompanying discussion. Followed by graphs generated from simulated data and its implications. The paper concludes with an explanation of possible weaknesses and limitations.

The data is obtained from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) hosted on the DHS website in PDF formats. We obtained data from the Turkey DHS Final Report from 1998 @DHS. The report consists of a wide range of data regarding Children health and its indicators such as mortality, nutrition, water supply and education. Further, other supporting indicators data is provided such as mother's health and nutrition and infant vaccination rates.
We obtained table 9.4 from the Turkey 1998 DHS Report for our analysis.This table consists of important statistics regarding birth statistics such as mother's age at birth, child birth order, residence of birth, region of birth, mother's educational attainment levels and total number of antenatal care visits during birth. These variables are further classified by the place of delivery of the child - at health facility or at home. 
In terms of confidentiality, only aggregate levels were used to construct the table and no micro data containing individual patient information has been obtained or utilized. The method of categorization of this data set (ordering by place of delivery) limits us to compare data to other similar reports.

For conducting this analysis we used the R programming language @citeR, and libraries such as @tidyverse, @knitr and @ggplot2. 

As stated previously, we look at Table 9.4 from the Turkey 1998 DHS Final Report on pages 109-110. We consider all sections of this table - Mother's age at birth, birth order, residence, region, education and Antenatal Care (AC) visits. We look at all the variables and match them with their respective columns regarding the place of delivery. We do so to gain a clear understanding on how hygiene patterns during delivery and proper medical attention affect birth outcomes in children. Table 9.4 is shown as Figure \@ref(fig:table1) below -

```{r table1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Place of Delivery  by Background Characteristics", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Results

We apply the legend here to specify the place of delivery for the following -
\newline
  - H - Birth delivery at Home \newline
  - HF - Birth delivery at Health Facility \newline
  - DK - Birth delivery information is unknown or missing \newline

```{r, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
df1 <- age %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_longer(HF: DK , names_to = "legend",
               values_to = "score")
df1

df2 <- b_order %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_longer(HF: DK , names_to = "legend",
               values_to = "score")
df3 <- residence %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_longer(HF: DK , names_to = "legend",
               values_to = "score")
df4 <- education %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_longer(HF: DK , names_to = "legend",
               values_to = "score")
df5 <- region %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_longer(HF: DK , names_to = "legend",
               values_to = "score")
df6 <- AC %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_longer(HF: DK , names_to = "legend",
               values_to = "score")
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot1 <- ggplot2::ggplot(df1, aes(x = age, y=score, fill = legend)) + 
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  labs(x ="Age groups", y = "Count in %")

plot2 <- ggplot2::ggplot(df2, aes(x = BirthOrder, y= score, fill = legend)) + geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  labs(x ="Birth order position", y = "Count in %")

plot3 <- ggplot2::ggplot(df3, aes(x = Residence, y = score, fill = legend)) + geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  labs(x ="Residence", y = "Count in %")

plot4 <- ggplot2::ggplot(df4, aes(x = Education, y = score, fill = legend)) + geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  labs(x ="Educational level", y = "Count in %") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))

plot5 <- ggplot2::ggplot(df5, aes(x = Region, y = score, fill = legend)) + geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  labs(x ="Region", y = "Count in %")

plot6 <- ggplot2::ggplot(df6, aes(x = AC_Visits, y = score, fill = legend)) + geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  labs(x ="Number of Visits", y = "Count in %")
```

Plotted below are the graphs for place of delivery by each background characteristic - 

```{r plot1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Place of Delivery by Mother's age at birth", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot1
```
These plots summarize the variables in our data set and how it impacts the place of delivery. To begin with mother's age in Figure \@ref(fig:plot1), the vast majority of mothers give birth at a health facility. However, a larger portion of mothers aged 35 and above give birth at home. 


```{r plot2, fig.cap="Place of Delivery by Child's birth order", echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot2
```
Also, looking at place of delivery based on child birth order in Figure 3 (Figure \@ref(fig:plot2)), a very large part of children born first were at a health facility. That portion goes down as the child birth order increases and at 6 or more kids, majority of children were birthed at home. 

```{r plot3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Place of Delivery by Residence", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot3
```
Based on Figure 4 (Figure \@ref(fig:plot3)), births at health facilities are much higher in urban residences and smaller for rural areas. This can possibly be attributed to more accessibility to health facilities in urban regions as there are more resources closer together, while residents in rural areas must travel farther distances to gain access to health facilities.


```{r plot4, echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "Place of Delivery by Mother's Educational level", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot4
```

(Figure \@ref(fig:plot4)) showcases how education level impacts place of delivery. Mothers with no education largely delivered at home. The higher the motherâ€™s educational level, the larger the likelihood of them delivering their child at a health facility. 

```{r plot5, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Place of Delivery by Region of Birth", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot5
```
In figure 6 (Figure \@ref(fig:plot5)) we visualize place of delivery by region in Turkey, every region except East has greater number of births delivered at health facilities. 

```{r plot6, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Place of Delivery by Antenatal Care Visits", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot6
```
Lastly, in figure 7 (Figure \@ref(fig:plot6))we can conclude that patients with more antenatal care visits used health facilities, but patients with no visits had mostly at home deliveries. This may indicate a lack of access for those mothers. Overall, we can conclude that mothers with less education, living in rural conditions, and with more children tend to deliver their children at home, compared to mothers in urban areas with higher education.

# Discussion

```{r, include=FALSE}
data <- readr::read_csv("data.csv")
data
```
## First discussion point

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(304)
dat1<-na.omit(data)
sample_df <- dat1[which(row.names(dat1) %in% sample(row.names(dat1), 500, replace = TRUE)),c(1,2,6)]
sample_df <- filter(sample_df, Background.Characteristic=="West" | Background.Characteristic=="South"
                	| Background.Characteristic=="Central" | Background.Characteristic=="North" |
                  	Background.Characteristic=="East")
  ggplot(sample_df, mapping = aes(x= Number.of.births, y= At.Health.Facility)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = "y~x")

```
This plot depicts the number of births at a health facility using simulated data of regions in Turkey from 1998. The line of best fit is horizontal with a very slight negative relationship. Essentially, there is no clear pattern and thus region is not a significant indicator of place of delivery.

## Second discussion point

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(304)
dat1<-na.omit(data)
sample_df <- dat1[which(row.names(dat1) %in% sample(row.names(dat1), 500, replace = TRUE)),c(1,3,6)]
sample_df <- filter(sample_df, Background.Characteristic=="First" |
                  	Background.Characteristic=="2 to 3" |
                  	Background.Characteristic=="4 to 5" |
                  	Background.Characteristic=="6+")
  ggplot(sample_df, mapping = aes(x= Number.of.births, y= At.Home)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = "y~x")
```
This second plot shows the number of births and amount of births at home, based on birth order. This illustrates the trend from a simulation that only includes information on the birth order. There is a clear negative correlation, indicating that the number of at-home births decrease as the number of births grows. Meaning that the birth order with higher number of births, hence first births and the 2-3 birth, have lower amounts of home as the place of delivery.


## Third discussion point

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(304)
dat1<-na.omit(data)
sample_df <- dat1[which(row.names(dat1) %in% sample(row.names(dat1), 500, replace = TRUE)),c(1,2,6)]
sample_df <- filter(sample_df, Background.Characteristic=="None" |
                  	Background.Characteristic=="1-3 visits" |
                  	Background.Characteristic=="4+ visits" |
                  	Background.Characteristic=="Don't know")
  ggplot(sample_df, mapping = aes(x= Number.of.births, y= At.Health.Facility)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = "y~x")

```
This plot showcases number of births at health facilities using simulations from antenatal care visits. The line of best fit is completely horizontal, meaning there is no trend between the variables. Antenatal visits has no correlation with number of births, it fluctuates regardless of amount. However, a higher amount of antenatal care visits means a larger portion of births at health care facilities.

## Weaknesses and next steps

Some possible weaknesses in regards to this analysis include the lack of information on the socioeconomic conditions of the respondents of the survey. This could play a substantial role in where women deliver their children. Additionally, the survey does not provide any information about the conditions of at home births. Those births could include health professionals but still be categorized as an at home birth rather than a health facility.

2. *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    - The dataset was created by research groups in Hacettepe University, Institute of population studies in collaboration with Macro International Inc. 
3. *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    - Technical and Financial support were provided both by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and primarily sponsored by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)

**Composition**

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
	- The instances represent the background characteristics of children and mothers in Turkey in 1998. The types are Mother's age at birth, Birth order, Residence, Region, Education and Antenatal Care Visits.
	
2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	- There are 21 instances. 
	
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- Yes. The data combines the total percentage of responses and includes values for "don't know and missing values".
	
4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
	- The instances are set up based on the group of background characteristics defined. 
	  - The first background characteristic consists of mother's ages during giving birth split by ages below 20, 20-34, and 35 and above.
	  - The second background characteristic consists of the order of birth of the child - first, second to third, fourth to fifth, sixth and above
	  - The third background characteristic consists of the residential setting during birth - urban or rural 
	  - The fourth background characteristic consists of the region in Turkey during birth - West, South, Central, North and East
	  - The fifth background characteristic consists of the educational level attained by the mother during time of birth - no education, primary education, secondary education and above
	  - The final background characteristic consists of the number of Antenatal Care (AC) visits - 0, 1-3, 4+, don't know or missing
	- The columns are split based on the place of delivery - at a health facility, at home or don't know/missing. Additionally, the table accumulates the total number and proportion of births. 
	
5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- The first column of each instance corresponds to the background characteristic being measures, labelled accordingly.
	
6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
	- Data in the table is aggregated and hence, have proportions of missing values of place of delivery for each background characteristic. Values were missing because they were not answered for in the survey.
	
7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
	- There are no relationships between individual instances

	- Not at the moment.
	
5. *If the dataset relates to people, are there applicable limits on the retention of the data associated with the instances (for example, were the individuals in question told that their data would be retained for a fixed period of time and then deleted)? If so, please describe these limits and explain how they will be enforced.*
	- Since we use aggregate data, the data does not relate to a specific individual. 
	
6. *Will older versions of the dataset continue to be supported/hosted/maintained? If so, please describe how. If not, please describe how its obsolescence will be communicated to dataset consumers.*
	- No
	
7. *If others want to extend/augment/build on/contribute to the dataset, is there a mechanism for them to do so? If so, please provide a description. Will these contributions be validated/verified? If so, please describe how. If not, why not? Is there a process for communicating/distributing these contributions to dataset consumers? If so, please provide a description.*
	- No mechanisms are in place as of now
	
8. *Any other comments?*
	- None
